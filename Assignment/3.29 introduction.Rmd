### Requirement

-   1 page

-   single-space

-   academic paper format

### Revised model

```{r}
biomassC ~ as.factor(diversity) + as.factor(success) + factor(plot) + (1|site) + as.factor(seasons) + as.factor(other interested envir factors)

biomassN ~ as.factor(diversity) + as.factor(success) + mineralization + nitrification + denitrification + factor(plot) + (1|site) + as.factor(seasons) + as.factor(other interested envir factors)
```

Note that

-   \"plot" can also be treated as a random effect. but there are only 4 subjects for it

-   interactions among our interested factors can be included in the future

-   other environmental factors can be treated as continuous or categorical factors
